There are many beautiful girls i met some of them are rich also. What she have special which others not?<br>
<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">1. Simplicity</FONT>: <br>
Now a days a girl wanted to be rich, famous and powerful. They always search any two atleast in men who have these And i know it better because two of them(famous and powerful). I Love jean because of her simplicity and
it's dosn't matter to her whatever i am she wanted just me.<br><br>

<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="0099FF">2. Trust</FONT>:<br>
In cyber world its very hard to trust on someone. It like you shooting arrow in dark. Because there are many peoples are fake here and if they are not peoples makes thier rumour like they know them personaly.
<br>~ As peoples said first am old man.<br>
~ Then they made rumour i have children.<br>
~ Then they made rumour i am married already.<br>
~ Then they made rumour i have many girl-friends.<br>
~ Then they made rumour i have a real relation with someone.<br>
am shocked! is there anything left? It feel completely doubt and enough to force somebody to move on.<br>
But they don't know that a relation stand on the trust. Even after they tried many times we were not
single effected. we Fight for it together. Because she is smart much she know if i was that type guy then
i had that offer already when i was free and single to fun and enjoy with beautiful girl. but she know that in world one time we all become serious and choose a life partner. she know that i made relation not just for timepass.<br><br>

<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="0099FF">3. Understanding</FONT>:<br>
she was a thousand miles away from me, not indian culture, But We have a good understanding..
she treat like we know each other from long years. Our time zone not match but we connected always..<br><br>

<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="0099FF">4. Caring</FONT>:<br>
As a man i never care myself much. i like hard working, helping, busy in learning and developing technologies.
My mom always worry for me coz once i open laptop or pc i forget to take food even drink. I forget everything then just focus in my work that's why am thin. After my mom and sister its jean who was caring me and reminding me keep
that i should take food and feeling me that she is missing me. if i didn't message her she message me then. If i didn't reply she do ISD call or ISD message. We never cared about money in relation.<br><br>
<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="0099FF">5. Feelings</FONT> :<br>
This most precious thing is "feelings for me". Yes, According to my thinking a feeling for somebody is more
important then anything in the world. Feelings makes caring, understanding, trust.. Sometimes this feelings makes
so special for a moment that you feel you are flying in air and you keep smiling. Feelings grow love,peace,strength. If you have feelings for somebody then it dosn't matter that she beautiful or ordinary.
You do love them like its your first responsibility and will never gonna let them go away. You will fight for them until your last breath same we both feel.<br><br>
A true serious man look only these thing in a woman. which i found in her. Our feelings was so much deep that one day i added my sur name in her name. A boy do that after marry only but i wanted to booked her before marriage. After her i feel first time how beautiful life is and first time i feel fear from death. When you fall in love so deep then you feel life is really very short. I am stupid boy not good sharp memory but i wanted to become a great man and spend my whole life with her. when i become grandfather then i wanted to tell our love-story to our grand-child. But god know what gonna future.. 
i wanted to say thanks for making my life colourful and very lucky in world who had girl like you.<br><br>
