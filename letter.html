                    	A letter to my honey<br>
                        <h3 class="title">my lady,</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                        I don't know what happen to you now. It seems you are sad now a days much just miss-understanding. I am Not Perfect boy and we can't promise anybody to make them life time happy only we can try do to be with them till last breath. My heart is pure my love is pure and my all feelings are pure.						
						</p><p class="paragraph">
                        When a boy really fall in love he shout his love to the world so that everybody can hear that he fall in love. I made 4 girlfriend before you but you i was the first one who made smile on my face.You are the first one who feel me what is true love I was very very happy with you. You are thousands of miles away from me but still i feel you just somewhere near to me. I see you everywhere don't know when i was fallen truely fallen and serious with you.
						Your caring, love, and true feelings was feel me first time happiness and peace of love. I never smiled before i met you don't know how to smile. But now if i remember our beautiful past days And a smile comes in my face and i feel happy. I never feeled before that how beautiful life is. <b>Tell me how can i think then to live without you?</b></p><p class="paragraph">
                        After see you sad or hurted or cry i how can i normal. If you not there and am online then i do other works. Like updating tracerbot,mobileserver or personal toolz, hackings or learning new things. I don't like to do fun with other girl(flirting). If i come online i see first you then i just online to see when you start chat with me. i wait when you gona free dont talk with anybody if somebody do then i just reply on dealing,helping topics</p><p class="paragraph">
                        when you love someone then you can give any cost to be with her. Yep, its costly to call ISD but i just call you so that i let be in close to you always. Money can buy jewellery, land, company, employee but can't give feelings of someone. for me you are precious thing for me then anything. If my love was fake then i never do such hard work for you and never care and worry when you sad.
						never takes tension for you when you sad. Many peoples now jealous with us coz they wanted to true love like us. Some of them wanna break us. I can't face them alone if you come in thier words because my power in inside your love.
						Don't know who say always wrong about me. You think wrong and not only hurt yourself you hurt equally to me also. sometimes feel that i just giving you excuse thats why you not feel it and you doubting yourself why a boy love you very much. Well with you i feel true and real feeling of love which i need from my life-partner. But until you don't feel it you can't understand and trust on me.
						</p><p class="paragraph">
                        yes, I am stupid am inexperienced about life. I am serious with you want to ask you also some question. <br>
						will you always doubt with me? don't have single trust on me? because if you doubt like this then you never happy with me then.<br>
						Will you can be always happy? i do my best to give you all happiness but sometimes its reverse. But i still try to be with you<br>
						If my love is true then you will never let me go. Never think about it alone start think that thier is somebody a thousand miles far from you who is waiting for you. His Heart beating for you. I really love you and i will always love you.</p>
                        Your love,<br>
